      <p>My name is Tony Phelps and I am currently enrolled in the Data Science & Visualization Bootcamp at UCSD extension.
          I also work full time as an Event Technology Specialist, Sales Manager, and Operations Manager for a professional
          event production company in San Diego. After graduating from the Computing in the Arts program at UCSD and working

          prolems with technology, in particular: Data, Coding, and the vizualization of real data to convey insight into deeper
          problems and questions in the world.</p>
